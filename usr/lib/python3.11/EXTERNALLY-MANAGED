Error=To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
 python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
 install.

 If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
 create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
 Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
 sure you have python3-full installed.
